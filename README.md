#Nobel laureates for physics years 1901-2005

H0 (Null Hypothesis): There is no significant difference in the proportion of applied physics Nobel Prizes between the early period (1901-1950) and the recent period (1981-2025). The theoretical propensity has remained constant over time.

HA (Alternative Hypothesis): There is a significant increase in applied physics Nobel Prizes (decrease in theoretical propensity) in recent decades compared to the early 20th century
